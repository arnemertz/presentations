## Properties of Unit Tests
What are the desired properties of unit tests to make them most useful?
This talk goes through the most common use cases for unit tests and deducts those desired properties from them.
[Slides](./PropertiesOfUnitTests/PropertiesOfUnitTests.pdf)

The talk was held:

* At the [NDC TechTown](https://ndctechtown.com/) conference on August 31st in Kongsberg, Norway.
* At the [MeetingC++](https://meetingcpp.com) conference on November 19th 2022 in Berlin, Germany.

## Identifying Common Code Smells
I talk about what code smells are and show eight of the most common language agnostic and C++ specific code smells, as well as how to fix them.
Each smell is shown using examples from open source code bases. [Slides](./IdentifyingCommonCodeSmells/IdentifyingCommonCodeSmells.pdf)

The talk was held on several occasions:

* At the [MeetingC++](https://meetingcpp.com) conference on November 15th 2019 in Berlin, Germany (different title, [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z3K8Xnw6WQ))
* At the [C++ On Sea](https://cpponsea.uk) conference on July 6th 2022 in Folkestone, UK ([video](https://youtu.be/KFbrhXVb7pw))
* At the [NDC TechTown](https://ndctechtown.com/) conference on September 1st in Kongsberg, Norway.

## Bringing Clean Code to Large Scale Legacy C++ Applications
A talk about the experiences I gathered in several large and old enterprise C++ code bases.

I also transcribed the talk to a series of blog posts since there are no recordings:

1. [Clean up Large C++ Legacy Applications](http://arne-mertz.de/2016/09/clean-large-c-legacy-applications/)
2. [Large C++ Legacy Applications: Planned Refactoring](http://arne-mertz.de/2016/09/planned-refactoring-large-applications/)
3. [Large Legacy Applications: Tests and Modularization](http://arne-mertz.de/2016/09/legacy-applications-tests-modularization/)

## Learning and Teaching Modern C++
Some observations about what "Modern C++" might be, what challenges there are in teaching it and a comparison of the different sources we have for learning it. The talk was held on several occasions in slightly different versions:
