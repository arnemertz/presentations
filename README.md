A talk about the experiences I gathered in several large and old enterprise C++ code bases. 
([Slides](./CleanCodeLegacyCpp/BringingCleanCodeToLargeScaleLegacyCppApplications.pdf))  
The talk was held on several occasions:

* At the [Advanced Developers C++ Conference](http://adcpp.de/2016/) April 26th 2016 in Erding, Germany
* At the [Clean Code Days](http://www.cleancode-days.de/archive/handouts-2016.html) June 3rd 2016 in Munich, Germany
* At the [C++ User Group](https://www.meetup.com/C-User-Group-Hannover/events/230809304/) July 11th in Hannover, Germany
* At the [C++ User Group](https://www.meetup.com/CppUserGroupHamburg/events/232101627/) July 13th in Hamburg, Germany

I also transcribed the talk to a series of blog posts since there are now recordings:

1. [Clean up Large C++ Legacy Applications](http://arne-mertz.de/2016/09/clean-large-c-legacy-applications/)
2. Refactor Large C++ Legacy Applications
