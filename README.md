## Bringing Clean Code to Large Scale Legacy C++ Applications
A talk about the experiences I gathered in several large and old enterprise C++ code bases. 
([Slides](./CleanCodeLegacyCpp/BringingCleanCodeToLargeScaleLegacyCppApplications.pdf))  
The talk was held on several occasions:

* At the [Advanced Developers C++ Conference](http://adcpp.de/2016/) April 26th 2016 in Erding, Germany
* At the [Clean Code Days](http://www.cleancode-days.de/archive/handouts-2016.html) June 3rd 2016 in Munich, Germany
* At the [C++ User Group](https://www.meetup.com/C-User-Group-Hannover/events/230809304/) July 11th in Hannover, Germany
* At the [C++ User Group](https://www.meetup.com/CppUserGroupHamburg/events/232101627/) July 13th in Hamburg, Germany

I also transcribed the talk to a series of blog posts since there are no recordings:

1. [Clean up Large C++ Legacy Applications](http://arne-mertz.de/2016/09/clean-large-c-legacy-applications/)
2. [Large C++ Legacy Applications: Planned Refactoring](http://arne-mertz.de/2016/09/planned-refactoring-large-applications/)
3. [Large Legacy Applications: Tests and Modularization](http://arne-mertz.de/2016/09/legacy-applications-tests-modularization/)

## Learning and Teaching Modern C++
Some observations about what "Modern C++" might be, what challenges there are in teaching it and a comparison of the different sources we have for learning it. ([Slides](./LearningAndTeachingModernCpp/LearningAndTeachingModernCpp_4_3.pdf))  
The talk was held on several occasions in slightly different versions:

* At the [MeetingC++](meetingcpp.com) conference on November 18th 2016 in Berlin, Germany. [[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5wOrhL4ew8)]
* At the [ACCU 2017](https://conference.accu.org/site/) conference on April 28th 2017 in Bristol, UK. [[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlh-UnmCARk)]

## Code Reviews - Why, What, and How
Collected best practices about how to do code reviews and what to review, as well as some background why code reviews are a useful tool.
([Slides](./CodeReviews/CodeReviews.pdf))
